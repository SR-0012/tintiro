# tintiro
This HTML and JavaScript code creates a simple dice game in a web page, featuring a dynamic and engaging user interface. The game involves rolling six dice, divided into two groups of three to represent the "child" and "parent" roles in traditional Japanese dice games. The core gameplay mechanics are implemented through JavaScript functions like Saikoro1 to Saikoro6, which generate random dice rolls, and calculateScore, which calculates the score based on specific combinations of dice values. The game allows players to place bets, and the final outcome (win, lose, or draw) is determined by comparing the scores of the child and parent dice rolls.

The page's visual design is styled using CSS, creating an aesthetic that emphasizes a dark background with bright text for a striking contrast. Elements such as dice images, result displays, and a roll button are arranged in a user-friendly layout. The button triggers the rollDice function, which computes the game's outcome and updates the interface with the results, including the winner and the amount won or lost based on the bet placed.
